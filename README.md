## Games rules

1. Each player is give a said amount of lives to play. The goal of the game is to be the last standing player. 
2. In the start of game each player will be dealt one card. 
3. The game is played in a series of sets. Each set is composed of one or more rounds. Prior to each set each player must predict how many of the rounds said person will win.
4. A round is won by playing the highest card. If two players play a card with the same rank value their cards will cancel out and neither would be able to win said round. 
5. In the chance that no player wins a round the following round of the set (if there is one) will be worth whatever the prior round was worth plus one. So if the prior round was worth one and there wasn't a winner then the next round is worth two. If a player were to win that next round it would count as two makes.

Different from the other cards the suit of the card matters. Ranking of suits goes, from hightest to lowest: clubs (♣), hearts (♥), spades (♠), diamonds (♦).
